                  Hi. My name is Cavan Meade, and I attend South Mecklenburg High School, and I'm running for Freshmen Council.
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>But who am I beneath that line?</strong>
                  <br><br>
                Outside of school, I stay active with Tae Kwon Do. As a black belt, it is my job to help and (hopefully) inspire younger ranks. I help judge competitions, and work with the younger students to improve their skills as martial artists. I attend Tae Kwon Do multiple times a week, showing my constant dedication to this leadership role.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 I also participate in Musical Theatre. This is something I have been doing my whole life, and I enjoy both working as a cast member, and as a director. I enjoy performing, but my favorite part of theatre – what draws me to it – is the people. From the shows I have performed in, I have learned the most valuable part of success is the community – the cast. This is something I apply to my everyday life, striving to build a public sphere of support, to create that “cast” of people, who together can make the show, the community and our school a better place.
                  <br><br>
                  I have an older brother (pictured behind) who has led me throughout my life. That said, I have led him too. As the younger one, I often felt overshadowed by my brother’s successes. I felt I needed to prove to everyone that I was just as good. However, through the years I came to learn that I didn’t need to be like him, I needed to be myself. And that is who I am. I am not afraid to accept challenges that seem beyond me, and I work everyday to show this. Despite being the younger brother, I helped my sibling when he needed it, trying to look at whatever problem through a different lens, my lens. I hope, with your support, that I can be the lens this school needs.

                <p class="custom-text align-center custom-white pb-3 custom-fonts-style display-7">
                  During my time at Carmel Middle School, I, along with some of my classmates, began the Student Betterment Council, a group of students dedicated to helping improve the school for the students. As a founder of this council, I both helped and led my classmates in and with our endeavors to improve the school. I used my connections with teachers and other students to help realize our goals - <strong>the student body's goals.</strong>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Along with SBC, I was a part of the Yearbook Staff. I worked on both pictures and design, while making sure to get student input. This dedication to creating a yearbook for the students, by the students helped to shape me as a leader and as a good team member.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As both a black belt and a member of the National Junior Honors Society, I helped with many community projects, obtaining many service hours through these. However, it was never about the number of hours, but instead my wish to better the community, which I did through leading different areas of each service project. Every year I participate in a service project with my family to clean-up schools around Charlotte. Ever since the first year I did it, I have always asked my family to go each year, as it is both fulfilling and enjoyable. <strong>With your vote</strong>, I hope to bring this joy and feeling of commitment to South Mecklenburg High School.
